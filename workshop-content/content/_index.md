### AWS Sydney Partner Summit 2020

# Fullstack of the Future

### Photo-Sharing Web Application with AWS Amplify

Welcome to the AWS Amplify Fullstack labs for **AWS Partner Summit 2020.**

In this workshop, we'll use React to build a data-driven web application that lets users upload photos to secure photo galleries. We'll use AWS AppSync to get up and running quickly with a GraphQL API that backs our data in Amazon DynamoDB. In addition, we'll demonstrate how to use the AWS Amplify library to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and manage photo uploads. Finally, we add in AI-powered object tagging using Amazon Rekognition, allowing users to discover photos without any manual data entry.

Navigate to the Prerequsites menu or click the 'Next' Arrow to begin.
